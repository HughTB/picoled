# picOLED

picOLED is a personal project which aims to create a small USB/serial display which can be connected to a computer to
show important information, such as CPU or Memory usage at a glance.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- A Raspberry Pi Pico or other RP2040-based development board with an I2C bus
- An SSD1306 OLED display with an I2C connection
- A computer with an available USB connector, if wanting to place inside the computer, you can obtain an internal
USB-2.0 to Micro-USB cable

### Installation

- Coming soonâ„¢
- While the functionality is there for the actual picOLED device, I still need to write a driver for Linux and/or Windows
